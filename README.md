# What is aiobrultech-serial?

This library talks to devices from [Brultech Research](https://www.brultech.com/)
over their serial port, using
[siobrultech-protocols](https://github.com/sdwilsh/siobrultech-protocols) to
decode the data.

## Installation

```
pip install aiobrultech-serial
```

## Usage

```python
from aiobrultech_serial import connect


async with connect("/dev/ttyUSB0") as connection:
    async for packet in connection.packets():
        print(f"{packet}")
```

Look at [`scripts/dump.py`](https://github.com/sdwilsh/aiobrultech-serial/blob/main/scripts/dump.py)
for a fuller example.

### API Calls

This library also supports getting and setting information on the attached
device. It supports all of the API calls available in
[siobrultech-protocols](https://github.com/sdwilsh/siobrultech-protocols).
